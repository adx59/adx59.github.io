Hello!

Before anything else, PLEASE sign up for a Bear Talk (linked, Brown sign-in required). 
I'd love to get to know you as one of my residents so I can support you better!

I'm Adam Xu. I'm the Community Coordinator for your floor. If you need to contact me, please knock on my door, call 
the number on my door, or text me via GroupMe. I am always available and will respond to you promptly.

My community hours are Friday 1-2 PM and Saturday 11 AM - 12 PM in the 4th floor lounge.

Things I'm (tentively) planning for this floor:
- A crochet event in February!
- A paint night in March!
- Folding dumplings in April!
Please let me know if you have any ideas for any programming!

A little bit about me:
- I'm Chinese-American and am from the Bay Area of California.
- I'm concentrating in Computational Biology.
- I've taken lots of premed coursework and CS coursework, so feel free to use me as a resource!
- At Brown, I lead Brown Motion Pictures and am a submission grappler for Brown Mixed Martial Arts.
- I enjoy crocheting and am learning the guitar :D
